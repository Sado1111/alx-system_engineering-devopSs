#!/usr/bin/env bash
#Bash script that displays all active IPv4 IPs on the machine itâ€™s executed on.

#This possible by running ifconfig command, grep inet, grep out (avoid) inet6 i.e.
#IPv6 addresses, we only need IPv4 addresses -
#so we would get 2nd field of lines with inet for IPv4 addresses

ifconfig | grep 'inet ' | grep -v 'inet 6' |  awk '{print $2}'
